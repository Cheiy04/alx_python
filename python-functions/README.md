# This project will be used to showcase on how to use basic python functions to solve tasks
The tasks include:
* function that adds two integers and returns the result.
* function that computes a to the power of b and return the value.
* function called convert_to_celsius that takes a temperature in Fahrenheit as input and returns the temperature in Celsius.
* function called reverse_string that takes a string as input and returns the reverse of that string.
* function called fibonacci_sequence that takes a number n as input and returns a list of the first n Fibonacci numbers.
*  function called is_prime that takes a number as input and returns True if the number is prime, and False otherwise.
* function called validate_password that takes a password as input
